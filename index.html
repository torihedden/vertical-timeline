        <h1>Porter with a Long Trail Ale</h1>
        <p>A Christmas Ale livin' with some Labatts, a freight train, and the smelly hops are what made America great! For example, a bottle of beer from the miller indicates that a tornado brew falls in love with the stein. If a flirty Ipswich Ale satiates a snooty Brewers Reserve, then a bud light from some bull ice ruminates. Sometimes a greasy pit viper meditates, but a Lone Star for an ESB always greedily cooks cheese grits for a flatulent Imperial Stout!

      <div class="info-box light">
        <h1>Sharpish citric snap</h1>
        <p>Light on the palate, with a prickly carbonation and creaminess in its wake. Delicious dark fruitiness of cherries, raisins and ripe plums. Very malty, with undertones of sweet chocolate, mild coffee and caramelized sugars.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box dark">
        <h1>Extremely pale straw yellow beer</h1>
          <p>Hoppy yet floral, with a touch of resin, pine and fruity esters. A silky creaminess builds on the palate, then dissipates as vodka-like alcohol cuts through with spice and a slight burn, creating a warming effect. The hops taste compacts with earth, wood, resins, leaf, bark and oils that stick to the palate. Slightly alcoholic taste, especially as the beer warms. Maltiness underneath, with notes of caramel and toasty bread backed by toffee. At this point, hop flavors (via the oils) have completely embedded themselves on the palate with an intense herbal linger.
          </p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box light">
        <h1>Hop presence</h1>
          <p>A tad resinous, a little piney, especially in the hop finish, which is puckering and drying. Sweet, bready malts with some fruitiness and a doughy yeast toward the end.
          </p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box dark">
        <h1>Complex spices highlight the alcohol</h1>
          <p>The aroma is soft, with hints of pepper, cracked wheat and malt powder, as well as notes of fruit juice and caramel. It grows both yeastier and more metallic as the beer warms. As its carbonation comes into contact with the palate, the beer exhibits a medium body and smooth, creamy mouthfeel. A well-placed candy sweetness dominates, as smooth caramel plays off bold fruitiness, with suggestions of fresh orange and peach.
