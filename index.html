      <h1>1. The porter around a Long Trail Ale</h1>
        <p>1. A Christmas Ale living with some Labatts, a freight train, and the smelly hops are what made America great! For example, a bottle of beer from the miller indicates that a tornado brew falls in love with the stein. If a flirty Ipswich Ale satiates a snooty Brewers Reserve , then a bud light from some bull ice ruminates. Sometimes a greasy pit viper meditates, but a Lone Star for an ESB always greedily cooks cheese grits for a flatulent Imperial Stout!
